Leveling
The player gets their level exp the longer they survive in their climb.
At the end they press a button to calculate their exp gained to add to their level.
Every 5 levels or so, the player unlocks a new character with an unique animation.

Ideally, withing the first five minutes the players can unlock their first character, meaning that leveling is easy and fast, but the more they level up more they have to play.
